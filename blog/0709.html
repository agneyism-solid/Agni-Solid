          <h3>how do we know which information to trust?</h3>
          <h5>2019-07-09T13:24:07+0400</h5>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Information can be categorized as tangible, visible, auditory, etc., and also categorized as more or less present and vivid.
            We may hear things we can&rsquo;t see, or see things which are not making sounds.
            There are infinite ways and reasons to value any information, and likewise infinite utilization possibilities.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Many of us give a lot of consideration to theism, where divinity can be godly, which is simple and personal, and/or heavenly, which is more the vastly infinite aspect of divinity.
            Usually, divinity means that which is greater than we are, greater than these lives of ours are.
            Greater can mean stronger, more beautiful, more capable, more pleasant, kinder and more compassionate, and so forth.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Any of us might make our own choices and be influenced, by each other and by our readings and by other sources of information, in our decisions about whether and how to acknowledge greater-ness.
            Often, theism addresses quantum differentiation, such as the existence of realities so much greater than ours is that we cannot from this level even locate or measure exactly where the boundaries are between here and there.
            Many debates go on about questions like, &ldquo;If something is higher beyond our view of it, should we use what abilities we have to think and reason in this world for the contemplation of what that truth above us might be?&rdquo;
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Innumerable stories are shared and passed along telling of various perceptions and realizations found by saints and seers and religious visionaries of all types.
            Much of this type of information, which gives that some of us found what we thought was worthy of looking up to, but what many more of us have yet to see with our own eyes, is further debated as being canonically questionable, or maybe better categorizable as apocrypha.
            Plenty of it is said to be mere fantasy or otherwise irreligious or in whatever fashion not within the scope of what the average audience would think of as having appropriate association with our rituals of worship.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Then we have the type of differences that occur between the two (or more) sexes, amongst the various races with their distinct cultures, and between and amongst the various continents and nations and municipalities of Earth.
            Languages of the East are filled with their accounts of Asian gods and goddesses and heavenly affairs.
            Stories from Africa and the Americas elaborate many colorful deities with their adventures and favoritisms and designs.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Also we might look at the politics of monotheism vs. polytheism.
            Monotheistic simplicity is very popular on Earth; so many of us like to envision the angels and saints and divinine personages above us cooperating, so much better than we do down here, that they could rule civilization as a unity with a single God amongst them, often with a partner Goddess.
            However, countless alternatives are found, praising multitudes of divine humans, even anthropomorphic and zoomorphic combinations, and while strong (even deadly) opinions are waged, we still often have to confess that the majority of stories included within the mythologies of Earth are unverifiable to our judgments of ultimate truth.
          </div>
          <br><hr width="61.8%"><br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Now we ask our selves (and plenty of each other), &ldquo;What do I (and/or we) believe, like to believe, profess believing, etc., when considering quantum distinction above?&rdquo;
            We may have been raised by families that encouraged or enforced specific faiths and dogmas, we may have met friends who introduced us to new ideas, and then of course once we developed interest and skills in reading, we encountered limitless alternatives.
            Some of us make decisions and choices as we proceed, and many of the opinions and practicalities that go with our choices can last a lifetime and beyond.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            In my own creative writing, I am often reviewing and reexamining my own preferences theistically.
            I have certainly learned to accept that &ldquo;Yes, greater does exist.&rdquo;
            I have also always held a sense of love in my heart for God above me that has stayed being the simplest truth of all, amongst all the truths I&rsquo;ve learned in the course of four or five decades.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Numerous paths and faiths and creative religious interests have gotten my attention, even often devotion, but I still to this day prefer a monotheistic commitment to a single God above.
            I think of God as being one, even for all of this great planet Earth, and so though we have many different languages and cultures, I&rsquo;m always looking to see what any specific society may have worshiped as being their version of a singular God.
            Alternate cultures do have alternative strengths, but even though one side of the planet may be in many ways opposite the other, I&rsquo;ve often been able to make sense of Whom I think God is, within a given context.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            I&rsquo;ve learned a very hard lesson in this life of mine so far, and it seems to be the type of lesson that is taught to any of us through the Ages who feel inspired to express our visions of the hidden world to this one.
            We think we&rsquo;re finding some of what could help those whom we see here, simply by speaking of what we think we&rsquo;re recognizing, and maybe pointing out the means by which to also witness what of it is supposedly worthy of witnessing.
            But there are reasons why these realities are not seen by the majority of life on Earth.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Slowly, I&rsquo;ve been gaining an appreciation of the difference between Church and State.
            The Church, I guess, is that type of gathering and organization which is formulated and enlivened for the purpose of referencing, even worshiping, the quantum divinity that is above our present level of life.
            State government, however, exists for the protection and safety of this world where we are doing our very best to stay sane and to live enjoyable lives with what we are given to make ordinary sense of.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Thus in learning what the function of each is, I reach another choice in life, which is to consider how I might prefer to work with either or both.
            I spent some very difficult years in jail, mostly for the lifestyle I adopted as I was devoting myself to the exploration of mysticism.
            I thought I had put those years (of incarceration) behind me already, but then love made me break down and cross the line with expression of hidden truths, hoping that the invisible world was showing me where a major adjustment to normal relativity could bring as of yet unenjoyed heaven.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            I had been a somewhat passionate enthusiast in earlier years, when it came to the endeavor to bring feminine love with me on my vision questing.
            Divorce, though, was the result, twice, of my neglecting the acceptabilities in life that are apparently very important to typical feminine preference.
            Now, I&rsquo;ve been reminded of how our government polices us when we stray too far from what average association judges as being appropriate sanity.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            I do love the mythologies and the learning process, but now having been warned again to stay within a certain safety zone, I have to make sure to balance myself and find those boundaries that our world deems suitable for where I am in the greater scheme of political relativity as is visible and approved.
            So, I&rsquo;ve got a website, with a blog, but no more trying to tell the local college-age bartenders and waitresses that we could create our own universe together, and so forth.
            I know that ascension effort is worth a great deal, but Earth respects a slow pace and a careful attitude in relation to those laws and policies which are meant to protect visible truth.
