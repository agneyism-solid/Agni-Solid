            the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)
          </h4>
          <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
            The WHATWG was founded by individuals of Apple, the Mozilla Foundation, and Opera Software in 2004, after a W3C workshop.
            Apple, Mozilla and Opera were becoming increasingly concerned about the W3C&#8217;s direction with XHTML, lack of interest in HTML, and apparent disregard for the needs of real-world web developers.
            So, in response, these organisations set out with a mission to address these concerns and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group was born.[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]
          </blockquote>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            I&#8217;m not previously familiar with WHATWG, so to start with, I&#8217;m just doing some casual reading, but still with my goal in mind, to learn more about anything that might help me with the XHTML+RDFa question.
            I&#8217;m going to give a few somewhat random quotes from the &#8220;HTML Living Standard&#8221; page of their website.[<a href="#ref2">2</a>]
            Their
            <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#history-2" target="_blank">
              History section</a>
            tells a little about XHTML: In 1998,
          </div>
          <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
            the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on an XML-based equivalent, called XHTML.
            This effort started with a reformulation of HTML4 in XML, known as XHTML 1.0, which added no new features except the new serialization, and which was completed in 2000.
            After XHTML 1.0, the W3C&#8217;s focus turned to making it easier for other working groups to extend XHTML, under the banner of XHTML Modularization.
            In parallel with this, the W3C also worked on a new language that was not compatible with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages, calling it XHTML2.
          </blockquote>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Then it goes into some intermediary history following the beginnings of XHTML but preceding HTML5, which it states that for various reasons had to &#8220;include what had previously been specified in three separate documents: HTML4, XHTML1, and DOM2 HTML.&#8221;
            And:
          </div>
          <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
            in 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the development of HTML5 &#8230;, and in 2007 formed a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the HTML5 specification.
            Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specification under the W3C copyright, while keeping a version with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG site.
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
            For a number of years, both groups then worked together.
            In 2011, however, the groups came to the conclusion that they had different goals: the W3C wanted to publish a &#8220;finished&#8221; version of &#8220;HTML5,&#8221; while the WHATWG wanted to continue working on a Living Standard for HTML, continuously maintaining the specification rather than freezing it in a state with known problems, and adding new features as needed to evolve the platform.
          </blockquote>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            In their
            <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#html-vs-xhtml" target="_blank">
              HTML vs XML syntax</a>
            section, they give that their specification &#8220;defines an abstract language for describing documents and applications,&#8221; and then that &#8220;there are various concrete syntaxes that can be used to transmit resources that use this abstract language, two of which are defined in this specification.&#8221;
          </div>
          <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
            The first such concrete syntax is the HTML syntax.
            This is the format suggested for most authors.
            It is compatible with most legacy Web browsers.
          </blockquote>
          <div style="text-align: justify">
            And, &#8220;the second concrete syntax is XML.&#8221;
            They then note: &#8220;the XML syntax for HTML was formerly referred to as &#8216;XHTML,&#8217; but this specification does not use that term&#8221; for various reasons.

              Introduction</a>
            of W3C&#8217;s Working Group Note RDF 1.1 Primer: &#8220;The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for expressing information about resources.
            Resources can be anything, including documents, people, physical objects, and abstract concepts.&#8221;[<a href="#ref3">3</a>]

          <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
            RDF/XML provides sufficient flexibility to represent all of the abstract concepts in RDF.
            However, it presents a number of challenges; first it is difficult or impossible to validate documents that contain RDF/XML using XML Schemas or DTDs, which therefore makes it difficult to import RDF/XML into other markup languages.

          <div style="text-align: justify">
            And:
          </div>
          <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
            RDFa alleviates the pressure on markup language designers to anticipate all the structural requirements users of their language might have, by outlining a new syntax for RDF that relies only on attributes.
            By adhering to the concepts and rules in this specification, language designers can import RDFa into their environment with a minimum of hassle and be confident that semantic data will be extractable from their documents by conforming processors.[<a href="#ref4">4</a>]

          <div style="text-align: justify">
            There, my own main purpose is addressed.
            I was already creating HTML pages easily enough, but wanted to progress with the Semantic Web.
            So I&#8217;m learning about attributes and so forth, and also developing an appreciation for the XML standards.

          <div style="text-align: justify">
            Again, from the Primer&#8217;s Introduction:
          </div>
          <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
            RDF is intended for situations in which information on the Web needs to be processed by applications, rather than being only displayed to people.
            RDF provides a common framework for expressing this information so it can be exchanged between applications without loss of meaning.
            Since it is a common framework, application designers can leverage the availability of common RDF parsers and processing tools.
            The ability to exchange information between different applications means that the information may be made available to applications other than those for which it was originally created.
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
            In particular RDF can be used to publish and interlink data on the Web.
            For example, retrieving <code style="color: #ff4500">http://www.example.org/bob#me</code> could provide data about Bob, including the fact that he knows Alice, as identified by her IRI (an IRI is an &#8220;International Resource Identifier;&#8221; &#8230;).
            Retrieving Alice&#8217;s IRI could then provide more data about her, including links to other datasets for her friends, interests, etc.
            A person or an automated process can then follow such links and aggregate data about these various things.
            Such uses of RDF are often qualified as Linked Data.[<a href="#ref3">3</a>]
