          From Wikipedia&rsquo;s definition of sanity, I&rsquo;m looking at the further definition of <i>compos mentis</i>, which seems very pertinent to the judgment of whether true Jainist ethic is applicable in late Piscean America where creative interest is told to wait for Jesus before initiating any creative effort of significance.
          Wiktionary gives the context of <i>law</i>, stating that <b>compos mentis</b> means one is &ldquo;of sound mind, sane; [and] thus criminally responsible for one&rsquo;s eventual wrongdoing.&rdquo;[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]
          How then do we look at the jurisprudent factors relevant to our situation: &lsquo;what would (or does) Jesus think?&rsquo; &lsquo;what do modern American churches and state think?&rsquo; and, if Jainism does have its place within a developing ascension of worthy note, &lsquo;what do the Jainists and similar &sacute;rama&#7751;as think?&rsquo;
        </div>
        <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
          In medieval and early modern Britain, the term <i>Non compos mentis</i> was often related to religious or mysterious phenomena such as diabolical influence.
          From the seventeenth century, the condition was increasingly viewed as a mental illness, also described as insanity or madness.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
          In English law, <i>Non compos mentis</i> was a juristic term to describe a person&rsquo;s action as not motivated by reason, but being influenced by some false image or mental impression … [for instance] … most commonly used when the defendant invoked religious or magical explanations for behaviour, as mentioned above.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
          Although typically used in law, this term can also be used metaphorically or figuratively; e.g. when one is in a confused state, intoxicated, or similarly mentally impaired.
          It usually refers to a person [who] has no rational mind or judgement, and whose behaviour is nonsense.[<a href="#ref2">2</a>]
        </blockquote>

          My approach, if I&rsquo;m trying to share any wisdom of value, is to first look at my own life to see if I can make sense of what I&rsquo;m doing, and then if I can, to offer my thoughts and so forth to the appropriate audience in a way that may help.
          So here, I see mention of diabolism, madness, religiosity, magic, confusion, intoxication, impairment, and nonsensicality.
          Unfortunately, I have had many of these elements plaguing my life, and so I have to wonder if I can somehow strengthen my justification, even though in the face of worries such as these might be, in the context of reviewing where I&rsquo;m coming from and how to proceed.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          I believe probably so, but the development of virtue has to be integral with these further justification efforts.
          Br&amacr;hma&#7751;ical relativity includes the confrontation of much that is inhumane, and so my history is littered with disqualifications whose designs are listed here as defining insanity.
          In my work with the salvation of priestly interest from demons and drugs and magic, I have suffered severe embarrassments and fatal rejections from persons of righteous demeanor.

        <div style="text-align: justify">
          So how should I move forward with a consideration of defensibility if I want to genuinely find the safer place for my combination of religious interests?
          I think I&rsquo;m going to start with my vision of what Jainism is and what it might be trying to teach me.
          Then I can come back to the question of whether and how Jainism might be acceptable in a modern American life, before I then address the concern for Jesus&rsquo;s opinion and/or judgment.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          Jainism certainly makes adequately standard reference to the unseen world, but where br&amacr;hma&#7751;ism often depends upon those levels of divinity which transcend our own human eyes, &sacute;rama&#7751;a</a>-dharma encourages respect for life where we as mere humans can see it and adjust the quality of how we treat it.
          Jainism carries some simple affirmations that arguers could accuse of magical emphasis; for instance, they have some complexity to their cosmologies and histories, and they offer prayers to liberated siddhas (perfected masters) beyond our view, and they discuss philosophies that distinguish types of ontological substance finer than might be verified by ordinary science.
          But their principles are so well founded in such very basic virtues as are quite defensible in any context that seriously challenges the judgment of what criminal behavior is.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          The only argument I could imagine trying to chase a seeker of truth all the way into the Jainist religious environment is the accusation that such an &lsquo;escapee&rsquo; of supposed offense against the more br&amacr;hma&#7751;ical world is using &sacute;rama&#7751;ism simply for its mildness, as a type of disguise or cushion against whatever feared reaction might be in pursuit.
          I have to say that this just about borders on athiesm, which is what truly priestly authority does not want as the actual guilt on their consciences.
          There is no appearance of evidence that Jainism discourages availability to debate; in fact it strengthens the practitioner&rsquo;s sense of &lsquo;right&rsquo; to speak for his (or her) own self.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          The principle of karma, of responsibility for one&rsquo;s own actions, in light of a lifestyle that is cooperative with a vast community of persons who are globally praised for their protection of peaceful activity, should be enough to police the aspiring Jainist.
          I am not in any way suggesting interference (even philosophically) with normal governmental jusrisdiction over the lives of the citizens of any nation on Earth.
          I am merely proposing that some witch-hunts have been given far more than enough audience attention for our present Age, and if we cannot bear to consider that the (often pseudo-)ecclesiastical judgment of <i>non compos mentis</i> or insanity is in fact being addressed by the qualitatively stronger examination of ahi&#7745;s&amacr; at its m&amacr;nasika level, which version of Jesus are we then expecting will show up to save our sanities?
