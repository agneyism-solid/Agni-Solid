          I&rsquo;m pretty happy with what I&rsquo;ve started this summer so far, using GitHub Pages via my
          <a href="https://04phoebus20git.github.io/04phoebus20/" target="_blank">
            04phoebus20</a>
          and
          <a href="https://agneyism-solid.github.io/Agni-Solid/" target="_blank">
            Agni-Solid</a>
          accounts with them.
          I&rsquo;ve got some interests with version control such that I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll maintain those accounts, but I do like consolidating if I can.
          I also started up another FANDOM Wiki site, again
          <a href="https://04phoebus20.fandom.com/" target="_blank">
            04phoebus20</a>,
          and the wiki format has special value and utility, so I&rsquo;ll keep that going and building as well.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          However, a good bit of what I&rsquo;m doing with each can be easily worked into this site, so that transfer of creative information will be one of my two initial efforts.
          The other is simply the continuation of what I was using those for, which is the release of obnoxious pressure to my sense of expressive priorities in general.
          I like being direct, and I love helping Earth, but too much of what targets me (psychically and so forth) is not really sanity-friendly enough, and so the work constantly waiting for me is very overburdensome.

        <div style="text-align: justify">
          Jainism is the main thing happening for me at present, and that means I&rsquo;m learning
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa_in_Jainism" target="_blank">
            ahi&#7745;s&amacr;</a>
          and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anekantavada" target="_blank">
            anek&amacr;ntav&amacr;da</a>.
          It also means I&rsquo;m becoming better familiar with what
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Arama%E1%B9%87a" target="_blank">
            &sacute;rama&#7751;a</a>-dharma
          is, and that&rsquo;s very, very important.
          &Sacute;rama&#7751;a-dharma is a significant new phase, in the context of a life (mine) that has been answering for decades to
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin" target="_blank">
            br&amacr;hma&#7751;a</a>-dharma,
          that is to the priesthood, rather than to my own effort, one&rsquo;s own effort being more truly what Jainist and Buddhist &sacute;rama&#7751;a is.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          Therefore I&rsquo;m beginning to recognize the how-to of managing my own life, where excessive dependency upon theism had previously been my mode.
          As I grew up in the more br&amacr;hma&#7751;ical type of environment, though actually its modern Western and quite (spiritually orphanedly) poor equivalent, I have a very strong foundation in theism.
          My conversion process in the adoption of Jainist (and eventually Buddhist) ethic is not merely a trade of one affirmation for another, whereby I would also be trading one type of corresponding nullification for the other.
          What I&rsquo;m doing is developing an appreciation for how strong one&rsquo;s devotion to non-violence (all three types: <span style="font-size: small">कायिक</span> (<i>k&amacr;yika</i>) &ldquo;personal,&rdquo; <span style="font-size: small">वाचिक</span> (<i>v&amacr;cika</i>) &ldquo;verbal,&rdquo; and <span style="font-size: small">मानसिक</span> (<i>m&amacr;nasika</i>) &ldquo;mental&rdquo;[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]) can ascend to someday being.

          My consideration of ahi&#7745;s&amacr; begins with this recognition of its three levels.
          K&amacr;yika means &lsquo;of the body,&rsquo; and that includes the likes of diet.
          While I did grow up as a vegetarian, I lost that aspect of virtue for years at a time, here and there, and need to return to that practice as soon as I can.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          The v&amacr;cika or verbal aspect of ahi&#7745;s&amacr; is a vital principle, and it means excercising control over one&rsquo;s urges to say anything that might cause pain to another.
          I&rsquo;m used to trying to speak what I see as being the truth, even when I know someone won&rsquo;t be liking that I&rsquo;m saying it, and so this is an area where I have a lot of improvement work ahead of me.
          For now, though, I&rsquo;m mostly concerned with the m&amacr;nasika part of respecting life and the soul, and that, for me, pertains to sanity.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          From the Wikipedia definition:
        </div>
        <blockquote style="text-align: justify">
          <b>Sanity</b> (from Latin: <i>s&amacr;nit&amacr;s</i>) refers to the soundness, rationality and health of the human mind, as opposed to insanity.
          A person is sane if they are rational.
          In modern society, the term has become exclusively synonymous with <i><b>compos mentis</b></i> (Latin: <i>compos</i>, having mastery of, and Latin: <i>mentis</i>, mind), in contrast with <i>non compos mentis</i>, or insane, meaning troubled conscience.
          A sane mind is nowadays considered healthy both from its analytical - once called <i>rational</i> - and emotional aspects.
          Furthermore, according to [G. K.] Chesterton [in his <i>The Outline of Sanity</i>], sanity involves wholeness, whereas insanity implies narrowness and brokenness.[<a href="#ref2">2</a>]
        </blockquote>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          If I&rsquo;m doing very much work with the expression, communication, and publishing of my thoughts and opinions about life, religion, and questions such as what it would mean to work together to improve quality of life on Earth, I might evaluate my own mental composition.
          Am I sane?
          Are the ideas I&rsquo;m sharing appropriate for sharing with a visible, real-world audience?
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          Of course I like thinking so, but if I&rsquo;m continuing to upgrade my socio-ecclesiastical status by initiating the presence of practical Jainism into my lifestyle, then I should honestly address that type of responsibility.
          Jainists are significant thinkers and philosophers, but especially they hold the superlative position amongst the faiths and religions of Earth when it comes to non-violence and respect for the integrity of the soul within all forms of life.
          If I promote myself as learning and adopting Jainism, I&rsquo;m essentially trying to present myself as having a certain quality of genuineness in my vision of what the greater good of our lives might be.

          My primary hesitancy for some years has been my ease of identification with Jesus.
          However, with Jainist perspective and interest developing, I might reconsider both of two factors: creator role and personal virtue.
          Yes, Jesus, including as the Vedic creator god Brahm&amacr;, is supposed to be virtuous; but too much of the expectation I&rsquo;ve picked up on in this life so far had to do with heavenly appointment rather than with simple respect for life and soul.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          The m&amacr;nasika aspect of ahi&#7745;s&amacr; calls for sanity to be judged in both ways.
          Jesus would have begun his mission with a strong sense of empowerment from God above, but the fighting that goes on amongst br&amacr;hma&#7751;as in their efforts to wield interpersonal and agentic power eventually has to be set aside in some fashion by a true Christ.
          During that actual lifetime when Christ was Jesus, this type of priesthood was represented especially by Caiaphas, the likes of Jesus&rsquo;s own then anti-Christ, but so much of that categorical tension is eternal.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify">
          The East preserves the essential ingredients of soulful life, but in modern-day America we have a specific lifestyle to defend, if necessary, but to enable and encourage according to its own designs.
          We can use the tools that India and its neighbors give us, but we have to find our language as well in this effort to bring Heaven and Earth worthily and salvably together.
          I&rsquo;m hoping I can work with some of this type of pursuit in a way that helps us be surer of how we are relating to Jesus, how we relate to modernity, and how we relate to some of those cultures on Earth that do persist through the Ages.
